Built our own Twitter-like service called "Shoutr" where I created "Shouts" instead of "Tweets." 
This application primararily focuses on the backend structure and not front end
So, feel free to checkout the organization, refactorization and have added comments to understand much better and shout.. :)

#Will work on the front end changes soon!
